TITTLE: Second one-page project (a project for ambitious people from Kodilla).

TECHNOLOGIES USED: html5, css3, rwd, jQuery, bootstrap.

DESCRIPTION: It's a more extensive project. This time I used Bootstrap which
is a very useful library. The documentation of Bootstrap is very friendly so
I didn't have any problems with that. As in the previous project, we can activate
a Modal by clicking the buttons. The modal is written in index.html file (it uses Bootstrap)
and is 'connected' to script.js file. There is also a simple carousel which uses
Bootstrap. I also added the scroll effect (click on the navigation). At the bottom
of the page there are 3 social media icons which redirect to  facebook, twitter and linkedin.
Bootstrap helped me a lot with rwd, because ready-made classes for smaller devices were already
done so I just had to add them into index.html file.
